# Battleships

This is a simple battleships game you can play with a friend. It was used to test the capabilities of WebRTC when used as an mutltiplayer event system. A standard 10x10 grid layout is used, with 5 ships of varying lengths. The game is played in turns, with each player taking turns to fire at the other player's grid. When a boat is hit an additional turn is given. The game ends when one player has no ships left.
